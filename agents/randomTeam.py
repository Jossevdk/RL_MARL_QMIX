    This function should return a list of two agents that will form the
    team, initialized using firstIndex and secondIndex as their agent
    index numbers.  isRed is True if the red team is being created, and
    will be False if the blue team is being created.

    As a potentially helpful development aid, this function can take
    additional string-valued keyword arguments ("first" and "second" are
    such arguments in the case of this function), which will come from
    the --redOpts and --blueOpts command-line arguments to capture.py.
    For the nightly contest, however, your team will be created without
    any extra arguments, so you should make sure that the default
    behavior is what you want for the nightly contest.
